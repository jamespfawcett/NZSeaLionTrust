                    <p class="team__grid-body-text body-text">I’ll never forget seeing two huge male Sea Lions at Surat Bay when I first arrived from England in 1999. To now be involved in advocating for the protection of both themselves and their environment is a privilege and an honour and the reason I joined the Trust. Sharing our beaches and habitat with sea lions brings joy to locals and visitors alike and I aim to ensure that they have a secure future in New Zealand.</p>

                    <p class="team__grid-body-text body-text">I studied grey seals for my Masters Degree in the UK and have had an interest in pinnipeds ever since. As soon as I set foot in Dunedin I joined the Trust as a volunteer and a few months later I became a Trustee. I now work as a dive instructor and feel very privileged to share their fantastic marine habitat and share this passion with students and customers alike.</p>

                    <p class="team__grid-body-text body-text">I started my MSc in Marine Science at Otago University in 1994 by following Katya, the very first pup, around on Otago Peninsula. She got me hooked on sea lions and inspired me to help set up the NZ Sea Lion Trust in 2003 and I have been involved in some capacity ever since.</p>

                    <p class="team__grid-body-text body-text">I arrived to New Zealand from Denmark almost two years ago, with a background as a science educator and ecologist. When people ask me what made me move to New Zealand I say that I came for the nature and stayed for the culture. The community engagement in conservation, that you find in this country, is unlike any I have ever experienced! and I am very excited to be able to work with such an iconic species as the New Zealand Sea Lion.</p>

                    <p class="team__grid-body-text body-text">I have several years experience working in research and tourism of cetaceans and spent the 2019 sea lion season on Campbell Island where I became fascinated with sea lion behaviour. In the same year I moved to the Catlins and wanted to continue to learn about the New Zealand sea lions and help towards their conservation, which is why I became involved in the Trust.</p>
